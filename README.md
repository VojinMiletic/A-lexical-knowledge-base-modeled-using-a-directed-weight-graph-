#A lexical knowledge base modeled using a directed weight graph 

 NOTE: I wasn't allowed to use libraries like STL , so I had to implement the STL::Vector class myself

• The goals of this project were:

  – Implementation and manipulation of a directed weight graph
  (adding and removing a node from a graph, adding and
  removing an edge from a graph, etc.)
  
  
  – Interaction with the knowledge base (determining the most
  similar words to a given word, etc.)
